Intern Name: Tanupriya Kaur
Task Title: Text Preprocessing and Cleaning in Python
Date: 13-05-2025
Internship Role: Data Science Intern
Company Name: NULLCLASS EDTECH PRIVATE LIMITED


Introduction

As part of my internship in the field of data science, my first hands-on task was to work with raw textual data. The goal was to clean and prepare the data in a form that is usable for further machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like embedding generation. This report documents my learning journey and implementation experience for the given assignment.


Background

Text data in its raw form is often messy and inconsistent. For machines to understand and analyze it effectively, it must be cleaned and structured. The task involved developing a Python script that can:
* Convert text to lowercase
* Remove special characters, and
* Tokenize the text into words.
This foundational task helped me understand how crucial preprocessing is before diving into advanced NLP tasks.

Learning Objectives

* Understand the importance of text preprocessing in NLP.
* Learn how to write clean and readable Python code.
* Get familiar with regular expressions (re module) and basic string operations.
* Develop a beginner-friendly and reusable Python function.

Activities and Tasks

* Researched standard text preprocessing steps.
* Learned how to use regular expressions in Python.
* Developed a Python function to clean and tokenize text.
* Tested the function with multiple text inputs.

Skills and Competencies

* Python programming
* Regular Expressions (re.sub)
* String manipulation
* Tokenization



Feedback and Evidence

Source code file submitted along with this report and feedback is yet to be received by the mentor.

Challenges and Solutions

Challenge:

 Initially, I struggled with regular expressions and cleaning the text correctly without removing essential elements like numbers or spaces.

Solution:

 I read documentation, watched short tutorials, and practiced with the re module until I understood how to craft patterns like [^a-z0-9\s]. I also tested my code on different sentences to make sure it was working universally.

Outcomes and Impact

* I now have a strong understanding of text preprocessing, which is essential for any NLP project.
* Gained confidence in using Python for real-world tasks.

Conclusion

This first internship task was a great introduction to how raw data is cleaned and structured in the real world. Not only did I strengthen my Python skills, but I also learned the importance of writing clean, maintainable code.
